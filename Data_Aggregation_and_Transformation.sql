SHOW TABLES from sakila;
SELECT * FROM actor;

-- 1.1 Determine the shortest and longest movie durations and name the values as max_duration and min_duration.

SELECT max(length) as max_duration
	FROM film;
 
SELECT min(length)  as min_duration
	FROM film;
    
-- 1.2. Express the average movie duration in hours and minutes. Don't use decimals.
-- Hint: Look for floor and round functions.

SELECT 
    FLOOR(AVG(length) / 60) AS avg_hours,
    MOD(ROUND(AVG(length)), 60) AS avg_minutes
FROM 
    film;

-- 2.1 Calculate the number of days that the company has been operating.
-- Hint: To do this, use the rental table, and the DATEDIFF() function to subtract the earliest date in the rental_date column from the latest date.

SELECT * FROM rental;
SELECT 
    rental_date,
    return_date,
    DATEDIFF(return_date, rental_date) AS rental_duration
FROM 
    rental;
    
-- 2.2 Retrieve rental information and add two additional columns to show the month and weekday of the rental. Return 20 rows of results.

SELECT * FROM rental;

SELECT 
    rental_date,
    MONTH(rental_date) AS month_number,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS day_of_week
FROM 
    rental;

ALTER TABLE rental
ADD month_number INT,
ADD day_of_week VARCHAR(10);

UPDATE rental
SET 
    month_number = MONTH(rental_date),
    day_of_week = DAYNAME(rental_date)
WHERE rental_id > 0;

SELECT * FROM rental
ORDER BY rental_id ASC
LIMIT 20;

-- 2.3 Bonus: Retrieve rental information and add an additional column called DAY_TYPE with values 'weekend' or 'workday', depending on the day of the week.
-- Hint: use a conditional expression.

SELECT 
    rental_id,
    rental_date,
    DAYNAME(rental_date) AS day_of_week,
    CASE 
        WHEN DAYNAME(rental_date) IN ('Saturday', 'Sunday') THEN 'weekend'
        ELSE 'workday'
    END AS DAY_TYPE
FROM 
    rental;

-- 3  You need to ensure that customers can easily access information about the movie collection. To achieve this, retrieve the film titles and their rental duration. 
-- If any rental duration value is NULL, replace it with the string 'Not Available'. Sort the results of the film title in ascending order.
-- Please note that even if there are currently no null values in the rental duration column, the query should still be written to handle such cases in the future.
-- Hint: Look for the IFNULL() function.

SELECT title,
	IFNULL(rental_duration, 'Not Available') AS rental_duration
    FROM film 
    ORDER BY title ASC;

-- Bonus: The marketing team for the movie rental company now needs to create a personalized email campaign for customers. 
-- To achieve this, you need to retrieve the concatenated first and last names of customers, along with the first 3 characters of their email address, 
-- so that you can address them by their first name and use their email address to send personalized recommendations. 
-- The results should be ordered by last name in ascending order to make it easier to use the data. 

SELECT 
CONCAT(first_name, " " ,  last_name, " " , ",", " " , SUBSTRING(email, 1, 3)) AS full_name
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name ASC;


-- Challenge 2

-- Next, you need to analyze the films in the collection to gain some more insights. Using the film table, determine:
-- 1.1 The total number of films that have been released.

SELECT COUNT(title) AS total_films
FROM film;

-- 1.2 The number of films for each rating.
    
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS number_of_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;
    
-- 1.3 The number of films for each rating, sorting the results in descending order of the number of films. 

SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS number_of_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY number_of_films DESC;

-- 2. Using the film table, determine:
-- 2.1 The mean film duration for each rating, and sort the results in descending order of the mean duration. 
-- Round off the average lengths to two decimal places. This will help identify popular movie lengths for each category.

SELECT rating,
   ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS mean_duration
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC; 

-- 2.2 Identify which ratings have a mean duration of over two hours in order to help select films for customers who prefer longer movies.

SELECT rating, 
    ROUND(AVG(length), 2) AS mean_duration 
FROM film 
GROUP BY rating 
HAVING avg_duration > 120; 

-- Bonus: determine which last names are not repeated in the table actor.

SELECT last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
